This plugin runs the test function pytest_slower

Do Qs 1-3 of the exercise at the end of Chapter 5 of Okken.

Add a pytest.ini file to the plugin you have created. Your file should ensure the following:

    That pytest will only test files in the tests directory and its subdirectories.
    That pytest will only run tests that are marked
    That pytest reports the reasons why tests have failed.

Create a file ex_7.tar.gz file that includes your configuration files, plugin, and test code.
